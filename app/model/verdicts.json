It was undisputed that, with the exception of a breech position which would have mandated a C-Section, that even without other complications, the pregnancy progressed normally until two days before the C-Section was ultimately performed, when it was determined that the plaintiff lost a great deal of amniotic fluid at 38 weeks six days into the pregnancy. The plaintiff contended that because the mother, who would have nonetheless required a C-Section, was at term, and because the pregnancy was considered high risk because of the in vitro fertilization, a C-Section should have been performed at that time, which was a Friday. <br /><br />The mother had a bicornuate uterus and had gone into labor over the weekend. When the surgery was ultimately performed on Sunday, the ob/gyn realized that the fetus had been compressed into the uterus, rendering it more difficult and taking much longer to complete the section. The plaintiff contended that as a result of the prolonged C-Section, the child suffered the oxygen related injuries. The plaintiff's expert ob/gyn contended that the precipitous drop in amniotic fluid was a clear danger sign, and that in view of the fact that the mother was already at term, a C-Section on Friday was mandated. <br /><br />The defendant contended that hospital policy precludes an elective C-Section before 39 weeks. The plaintiff countered that the procedure should not have been considered elective. The plaintiff also contended that the gestational age was an estimate and that in view of the evidence that the mother was so close to 39 weeks into term, the defendant's position should clearly be rejected. The plaintiff maintained that if the C-Section had been performed on Friday, such injury would have been avoided. The plaintiff further maintained that the mother's bicornuate uterus contributed to the fetus being situated significantly farther to the left right than would normally be the case, and that the performance of a midline incision that would usually be appropriate was not indicated in this situation, rendering the C-Section longer to complete and making it more difficult to extract the baby.<br /><br />The plaintiff's expert further contended that the fetus was compressed extensively into the uterus after the mother went into labor and that emergency steps to remove the baby more rapidly were not made. The evidence reflected that the birth was taped, and although the camera did not focus on the mother and child, the audio reaction by the defendant physician upon observing that the baby was \"stuck\" in the uterus was \"holy shit.\" <br /><br />It was undisputed that the event that caused the hypoxia injury and occurred shortly before the birth.

The plaintiff contended that as a result, the baby suffered hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The plaintiff maintained that the child suffered cerebral palsy, spastic quadriplegia, profound mental retardation, and requires a feeding tube. The child was also born with a genetic disorder known as Kabuki Syndrome. The plaintiff maintained that although this condition is known to cause mental retardation, it is generally relatively moderate, that individuals suffering this disorder can generally lead independent lives and that it was clear that the hypoxic insult, rather than this disorder, caused the profound injuries. <br /><br />The plaintiff contended that although signs of fetal distress were noted by the defendant midwife on the fetal monitor, she delayed summoning an ob/gyn for approximately 45 minutes as she unsuccessfully attempted different techniques, such as vacuum delivery. The plaintiff maintained that when the ob/gyn examined the patient, he called for an immediate C-section. The plaintiff asserted that the profound injuries resulted the prolonged period of hypoxia. The hospital was a Level 2 facility. The plaintiff contended that once hypoxia is noted, a C-Section in a Level 2 hospital should be performed within a-half hour.<br /><br />The defendant midwife denied that she was negligent. The defendants also denied that the child suffered hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The defendant pointed out that nucleated blood cells were detected in the umbilical cord blood. The defendant contended that such a sign probably reflected a chronic in utero condition. The defense also maintained that such cells would not form for at least several hours and it established that the child would have suffered the same deficits even if the midwife had called for a C-section upon observing the fetal monitor. <br /><br />The plaintiff's expert ob/gyn contended that it has been shown that such cells can form almost immediately upon a trauma such as hypoxia and certainly within one hour. The plaintiff's expert further contended that such cells can result from the birthing process itself. <br /><br />The evidence also reflected that in 2004, ACOG commissioned a study and listed major criteria which must be met before hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy should be associated with trauma during the birthing process. The plaintiff argued that the jury should consider that the plaintiff's expert ob/gyn was intimately involved in the process of creating the so called \"Green book.\" The plaintiff's ob/gyn contended that all of the criteria, including evidence of metabolic acidosis, which in this case was severe, the early onset of severe or moderate encephalopathy, a type of CP often associated with hypoxia, such as that causing spastic quadriplegia, and the absence of other potential etiologies, were present. <br /><br />The defense maintained that this last criterion was not met, and that the genetic disorder of Kabuki syndrome, which was not related to hypoxic insult, could well be the cause of the deficits. The plaintiff's geneticist contended that Kabuki syndrome, that involves much more moderate deficits, could not explain the CP in this case. The plaintiff's expert ob/gyn concluded that all of the criteria were met. The plaintiff also argued that the jury should take into account that the plaintiff's expert ob/gyn generally testifies for defendants only and that the study was commissioned to set criteria that would facilitate ruling out questionable claims. <br /><br />The plaintiff, who named the midwife and her employer, also contended that the hospital itself should be liable under an apparent agency theory. The plaintiff stressed that the name of the name of practice group is similar to the name of hospital, and that the parents reasonably believed that the midwife, who operates out of the hospital, was its agent. <br /><br />The defendant hospital argued that the similarity in name and the fact that the group rented space from the hospital was not sufficient to reasonably lead the parents to believe that agency existed. The hospital also elicited testimony from the parents that they wanted a midwife involved and that their belief that she was an agent of the hospital was not a primary reason for their choosing the midwife. <br /><br />The plaintiff contended that the infant plaintiff probably has an approximate 40 year life expectancy.

The defendant denied the allegations and disputed damages. <br /><br />The two-year-old plaintiff and his family were visiting other family members in Brazil. After returning home from the trip, the child had a decreased appetite, complained of stomach pain, cough and congestion. He was taken to his primary care physician who diagnosed the child with Giardia, one of the most frequently diagnosed intestinal parasitic diseases in the country. He was prescribed a bactericide, Flagyl. The doctor called the prescription into the defendant pharmacy. <br /><br />Since he was young and unable to swallow tablets or capsules the defendant needed to make the medication into a liquid form that the child could easily ingest. The father brought the medication home and the plaintiff was given one dose. 20 minutes after ingesting the medication, the child appeared drunk. He was unsteady on his feet, grew dizzy, lost his balance and fell down several times. His eyes appeared unfocused. The plaintiff's parents called 911. When paramedics arrived, the child was conscious and able to smile. When one of the paramedics picked the child up to carry him to the ambulance, the child became unresponsive and limp. <br /><br />He was unresponsive the entire ride to the hospital and paramedics applied a bag mask to keep the child ventilated. At the hospital the physicians were unable to diagnose the child's condition. An initial assessment referred to \"atypical febrile seizure, sepsis, meningitis and occult toxin ingestion\". Blood was drawn, a urinalysis was performed, a second intravenous was started and the child underwent a head CT-scan, all the while remaining unresponsive. The child underwent a lumbar puncture where the child barely moved at all. A drug Narcan was administered to reverse the effects of narcotics, but this did not improve the child's condition. <br /><br />He was intubated and transferred to another hospital that had a pediatric intensive care unit. Additional testing of EEG, chest X-rays, toxicology analyses, hematology analyses and a head MRI failed to disclose a diagnosis. His condition gradually improved and he was discharged with a diagnosis of allergic reaction to the bactericide. The child's father spoke to a physician in Brazil during this who suggested that perhaps it was not an allergic reaction, but rather a medication error. The parents had left the bottle of medication with the hospital. When the father called for the medication, it had already been sent to a laboratory for analysis. <br /><br />The analysis revealed that the medication in the bottle was not the Flagyl as it was supposed to be; rather it was Baclofen, a muscle relaxer and antispastic agent. It is sold under the brand name Lioresal and the pills are oval white tablets with the name Lioresal imprinted on one side. The medication that the child was supposed to have received, Flagyl, comes in tablets or capsules. The tablets are blue and round or oval and have Flagyl imprinted on them. The Flagyl capsules are iron gray with a light green cap and have Flagyl imprinted on them. <br /><br />The incorrect medication, Baclofen, is used to treat muscle spasms in patients with multiple sclerosis and an overdose can cause a coma. The infant was given one two ml dose of the medication in the bottle before he fell ill. The lab report indicated that bottle of medication contained 20 mg of baclofen per ml of liquid, which means that the plaintiff, who weighed only 31 pounds, received 40 mg of Baclofen. The normal adult dose of Baclofen is five mg three times daily. <br /><br />The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant pharmacy alleging negligence in causing the medication error. The defendant denied the allegations and disputed the plaintiff's claim of damages. The evidence indicated that the child recovered without any long term effects.
