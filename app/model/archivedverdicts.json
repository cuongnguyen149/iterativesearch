The infant suffered a fetal scalp laceration during the delivery, resulting in facial scarring. The child also suffers from facial palsy. The defendant denied the deviation from acceptable standards of care.<br /><br />The infant's mother presented for labor induction. The mother's cervix was not completely dilated at the time that the defendant took a fetal scalp blood sample.

The infant was born with facial palsy and left nostril laceration. The child, who is now ten years old, has permanent facial scarring and will require future surgery.<br /><br />The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant alleging negligence in failing to abide by the applicable standard of care when the mother was diagnosed with secondary arrest of descent and permitting the mother to continue to labor and in lacerating the child's nostril.
